# CS50AI Projects Repository

Welcome to the repository containing all my projects from the CS50AI course. This course provides a deep dive into the world of artificial intelligence and equipped me with hands-on experience in various AI concepts and algorithms.

## Description

CS50AI explores the fundamental concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence. The journey spans topics from game-playing engines and handwriting recognition to machine translation. Here's a brief overview:

Game-Playing Engines: Delving into the logic that drives your favorite computer games.
Handwriting Recognition: Understanding how machines interpret and recognize written text.
Machine Translation: Learning how AI bridges linguistic divides by translating text.
Graph Search Algorithms: The foundation for many AI operations.
Classification & Optimization: Tools to categorize data and find optimal solutions.
Machine Learning & Large Language Models: Grasping the magic behind predictions and human-like text generation.
The course provides students with hands-on projects that not only enhance their understanding of theoretical concepts but also empower them to implement these concepts in real Python programs. As a result, by the end of the course, students are well-equipped with AI libraries for machine learning, and crucial AI principles enabling them to design and craft intelligent systems.
